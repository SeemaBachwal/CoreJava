Sym Symphony (100 Marks)
James is a very talented musician. He is highly fond of symmetric tones and coins the term sym symphony for it. A tune is a sym symphony only if it gives the same sound when played from start to end or end to start. There are n notes provided to James and each note is represented by an integer. James is also provided m pairs(r = 2) of notes a and b, such that he can replace the note a with b.  James is given a symphony s with l notes, and he is required to tell what is the maximum length of  "sym symphony" he can make from that tune. Please keep in mind, he is not allowed to change the sequence of notes. He can only replace notes from m pairs of interchangeable notes provided and then choose a subsequence.

Transformations also have additional properties:

    If note a can be transformed to note b using a transformation, then note b can be transformed to note a as well.
    If note can a be transformed to note b and note b can be transformed to note c , then note a can be transformed to note c as well.


Input Format
The first three lines contain three integers n ,m and r. 
The following m lines each contain 2 space separated integers a and b, denoting a transformation from note a to note b.
Then there is an integer l denoting a number of elements in the symphony. The last l lines contains positive integers (notes of the symphony).


Constraints
1 <= n <= 10^5
 1 <= m <= 10^6
 2 <= r <= 2 
 1 <= l <= 10^3
 1<= x,y <= n
 1<= S[i] <= n


Output Format
Return an integer denoting the maximum length of Sym Symphony.

Explanation
In the array 1 9 2 3 10 3, we can substitute 1 with 3 and 9 with 10. Thus the array becomes 3 10 2 3 10 3. Now, we can choose a subsequence 3 10 3 10 3 or 3 10 2 10 3 both of which are palindrome of length 5. Hence, 5 is the output.
